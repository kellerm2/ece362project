Initialize and Enable ADC:

Configure the ADC to sample input signals.
Enable continuous or triggered conversion mode to continuously read analog data from the input.
Start ADC conversion and ensure that the ADC data register (ADC1->DR) is ready to be read by the DMA.
Configure and Enable DMA:

Configure the DMA channel to transfer ADC conversion results to the adc_buffer.
Set the DMA in circular mode so it continuously fills the buffer as new data comes in.
Link the DMA channel to the ADC data register, so it automatically fetches new ADC values as they become available.
Scale ADC Values for Display:

As the DMA fills the adc_buffer, use a separate function or loop to scale the data from adc_buffer into scaled_buffer.
This scaling process can occur at a periodic interval, or you can monitor the DMA transfer complete flag to trigger scaling after each buffer cycle.
Scale each value from the ADC’s range (0–4096 for 12-bit resolution) to the TFT display’s vertical resolution (e.g., 0–320 pixels).
Send Scaled Values to TFT via SPI:

Use the scaled_buffer values to draw bars on the TFT.
The SPI peripheral handles data transmission to the TFT, using commands and data sequences defined in your TFT library.
For each x position on the screen, draw a vertical bar whose height corresponds to the scaled ADC value, creating the visualizer effect.
